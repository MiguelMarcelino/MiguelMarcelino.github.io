## A bit about myself

Software development has always been more than just a profession for me. Fueled by my interest in experimenting with software and trying out new technologies, I am perpetually in search of the next source of inspiration for my upcoming projects. Whether it's something that motivates others to pursue their passions or a challenge so absorbing that I willingly isolate myself in a proverbial cave for two weeks, I wholeheartedly embrace the experience. 

Throughout my academic career, I enjoyed tinkering with distributed systems and exploring the realm of algorithms and data structures (a true world unto itself). During my masters I also developed an appreciation for computer architecture and began exploring the Microservice architecture.  However, my thesis work ultimately led me into the domain of transpilers, and I contributed to the development of the Py2many project. It was during my thesis that I developed an affection for static analysis.

Fortunately, I was able to carry this passion into my professional career, to some extent, by assisting in the integration of various static analysis tools into CI pipelines. So far, the journey has been quite rewarding and it has given me the opportunity to apply the microservices knowledge I gained from my personal project. Now, it's a matter of riding this train and seeing where the journey takes me.

## Ok... but why am I here?
I created this page to share knowledge. Whether it’s a personal insight, a deep dive into a topic I’m exploring, or just something I find interesting. If you agree, disagree, or have something to add, feel free to jump in. Great discussions lead to better ideas.

## Some of my projects

### PyJL
A transpiler that translates Python to Julia. It was built to speedup the development of Julia libraries and produce human-readable Julia source code. Despite it being at an early development stage, I managed to translate Python code into human-readable Julia source code that can achieve good performance.

### Java2Many
Transpiles Java code to many languages. The project started out as a Java to Go transpiler, but quickly evolved into a transpiler that translates to multiple target languages.

### Thoth
A knowledge base for the Computer Science. Enjoy a summarized view of all the technical terms and fancy jargon used in computer science. Check out a brief explanation about each technological term and learn with explanatory examples that showcase everything in action!
