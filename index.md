## A small introduction
Software development has always been more than just a profession for me. Fueled by my interest in experimenting with software and trying out new technologies, I am perpetually in search of the next source of inspiration for my upcoming projects. Whether it's something that motivates others to pursue their passions or a challenge so absorbing that I willingly isolate myself in a proverbial cave for two weeks, I wholeheartedly embrace the experience. 

Throughout my academic career, I enjoyed tinkering with distributed systems and exploring the realm of algorithms and data structures (a true world unto itself). During my masters I also developed an appreciation for computer architecture and began exploring the Microservice architecture.  However, my thesis work ultimately led me into the domain of transpilers, and I contributed to the development of the Py2many project. It was during my thesis that I developed an affection for static analysis.

Fortunately, I was able to carry this passion into my professional career, to some extent, by assisting in the integration of various static analysis tools into CI pipelines. So far, the journey has been quite rewarding and it has given me the opportunity to apply the microservices knowledge I gained from my personal project. Now, it's a matter of riding this train and seeing where the journey takes me.

## Ok... but why am I here?
For science! No, really. I created this page with the intent of sharing knowledge. Whether this is a personal opinion or a topic I am currently studying, I will be writing it here. Feel free to comment any time if you disagree. After all, "courage is what it takes to stand up and speak [but it] is also what it takes to sit down and listen" (Winston Churchill).


## Some of my projects:

### Somnus
The name Somnus in the roman mythology is the personification of <i>sleep</i>. This name was chosen as a tribute to all developers that give up their sleep to achieve a better quality product.
Somnus was created with the goal of offering services to a small community of programmers and at the same time provide them with a platform where they can test new Software and publish their findings in the form of articles. As said by Oscar Wilde: “Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes”. Throughout the years, Somnus evolved into a blog where I publish articles and comment on several aspects of computer science. You can find the articles here.

### PyJL
A transpiler that translates Python to Julia. It was built to speedup the development of Julia libraries and produce human-readable Julia source code. Despite it being at an early development stage, I managed to translate Python code into human-readable Julia source code that can achieve good performance.
